# KotlinJetpackInAction
A super-simple project demonstrating how to use Kotlin and Jetpack step by step. More information could be found in my posts:[ "Kotlin Jetpack In Action"](https://juejin.im/post/5ee624756fb9a047bb6a69cf)


## Why this project?

- I made this project as simple as possible, so that we can focus on how to use Kotlin and Jetpack rather than understanding business logic.
- We will rewrite it from "Java + MVC" to "Kotlin + Coroutines + Jetpack + Clean MVVM", line by line, commit by commit.
